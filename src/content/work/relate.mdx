testimonial:
  text: "We contracted Appcrafters originally to help us design the Total Family Management payments solution and scheduling module. We were highly impressed with the quality of the development task and the teamâ€™s ability to understand our vision intuitively. This project led to a long-term partnership. The project manager and developers consistently delivered satisfactory work. I highly recommend them for anything related to app design and development."
